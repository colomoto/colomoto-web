`SBML qual <http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/SBML_Level_3/Packages/Qualitative_Models_%28qual%29>`_
is an extension of the `Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) <http://sbml.org>`_ Level 3 standard,
designed for the representation of multivalued qualitative models of biological networks.
The first SBML qual proposal in 2008 led to the creation of the CoLoMoTo consortium.
The extension was accepted by the SBML community in 2011, after consulting the wider
community and refining the original proposal through additional meetings with developers
of various related software tools.

The final specification was approved by the SBML Editors in the spring of 2013.
