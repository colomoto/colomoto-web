About CoLoMoTo
==============

CoLoMoTo (Consortium for Logical Models and Tools) is a consortium of `research groups <members>`_ interested in logical modelling: modelers, curators and developers of methods and tools.
The consortium works on the definition of standards for model representation and
interchange (especially the `SBML qual <formats/sbml-qual.html>`_ format), and on 
the comparison of methods, models and tools.


This website reports on the `activities of the consortium <meetings>`_,
and provides an overview of `software tools <software>`_
and `biological models <models>`_ based on the logical formalism.
