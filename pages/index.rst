The aim of the project is provide a common toolbox, taking advantage of existing sofwares, gathering key players in the development of tools for discrete modelling of biological networks.
The goal is to define a network of research groups working on qualitative modelling of biological pathways.

This website provides an overview of `formal methods <formal>`_ and `software tools <software>`_ for the logical formalism,
as well as available `biological models <models>`_.
