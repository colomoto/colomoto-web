==============

CoLoMoTo (Consortium for Logical Models and Tools) is a consortium of `research groups interested in logical modelling <members>`_.
The aim of the project is provide a common toolbox, taking advantage of existing sofwares, gathering key players in the development of tools for discrete modelling of biological networks.
The goal is to define a network of research groups working on qualitative modelling of biological pathways.

This website provides an overview of `software tools <software>`_ for the logical formalism,
as well as links to some collections of `biological models <models>`_.
