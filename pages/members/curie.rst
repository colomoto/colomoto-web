.. description: Apply Systems Biology approaches to biological networks involved in cancer
.. members: Emmanuel Barillot, Andrei Zynoviev, Laurence Calzone

The objective of our group is, using a Systems Biology approach,
to understand the design principles of the biological networks involved in cancer,
to contribute to the development of new strategies for human cancer treatment,
and to propose new target molecules and cancer drugs.
