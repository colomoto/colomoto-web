The `Center for Integrative Genomics (CIG) <http://www.unil.ch/cig>`_ is a department of the Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne (UNIL).

The research at the CIG centers on genome structure and function in a number of different experimental systems and relies on a large number of different techniques.
It is performed by an international community of scientists, yet the character of the CIG is one of an integrated research center,
where interactions among groups are numerous both in formal and informal settings.

The `Vital-IT <http://www.vital-it.ch/>`_ group is a bioinformatics competence center associated to the `Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics <http://www.isb-sib.ch/>`_.
This group provides both computing infrastructure (high-performance computing and storage) and wide expertise in bioinformatics for life-science and medical research.
