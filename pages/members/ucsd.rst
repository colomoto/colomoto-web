The main research activities of Andreas Dräger are focused on the (semi-)automatic
development of large-scale metabolic and regulatory networks.
Algorithms for the inference of model characteristics are  developed based on
fundamental physical and biochemical properties, such as thermodynamics and reaction dynamics.
Another important aspect of this endeavor is the development specialized software tools for
efficient creation, simulation, and evaluation of biological systems models.
