Computational modelling enables the study of large and complex networks controlling cellular processes. Our goal is to develop generic tools for the modelling and analysis of large signalling and regulatory networks. For this purpose, we mainly rely on a qualitative modelling framework combining the generalised logical formalism and Petri nets. In a close collaboration with biologists, methodological developments are systematically challenged with real case applications, specifying and analysing models of cell proliferation and differentiation as well as pattern formation in multi-cellular systems.
