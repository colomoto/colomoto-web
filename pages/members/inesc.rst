The `SW Algorithms and Tools for Constraint Solving (SAT) group <http://sat.inesc-id.pt>`_ is part of INESC-ID (Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores: I&D), a research institution associated with the `Instituto Superior Tecnico <http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt>`_.

The long term objectives of the research group are: integer linear programming algorithms; discrete optimization algorithms and their applications; propositional satisfiability algorithms; applications of discrete optimization in electronic design automation; and formal verification of digital systems and digital system testing.
With applications to the verification of software, hardware and biological systems.
