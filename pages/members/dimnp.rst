The "Biological Physics and Systems Biology" team develops physical, mathematical and computer science approaches for
the understanding of the functioning of biological systems. At the centre of our approaches is the multi-scale modelling
of the biological processes by using statistical physics, dynamical systems and stochastic processes techniques.
Our priority is to identify system’s critical targets and essential mechanisms. This knowledge can be used to elaborate
new therapies against complex diseases. 


Our main research axis are:

* Large regulatory networks: from molecular interactions to biological function
* Biological physics of molecular assemby: from individual molecule to supramolecular organization and dynamics
* Multiscale approaches: from individual molecules and molecular interactions to virtual cell
