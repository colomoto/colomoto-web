.. description: We develop methods based on logic modelling to understand the deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to identify novel therapeutics.
.. members: Julio Saez Rodriguez, Thomas Cokelaer, Emanuel Gon√ßalves, Federica Eduati, Marti Bernardo Faura

The goal of our group is to acquire a functional understanding of the deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to apply this knowledge to novel therapeutics. This deregulation in how cell process and react to extracellular information is a hallmark of multiple pathological conditions. Our main application is cancer, but we also work on metabolic and auto-immune diseases.
Logic modelling based on phosphoproteomic data is a major tool in our group towards this end.
