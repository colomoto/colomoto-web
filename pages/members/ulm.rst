The Core Group `Medical Systems Biology <http://sysbio.uni-ulm.de/>`_ at Ulm University
pursues the development of new methods in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.
The research focuses on the development of mathematical models of regulatory processes
as well as on the analysis of high-dimensional biomolecular data.
The group is involved in several interdisciplinary consortia, such as the
`SyStaR consortium <http://www.uni-ulm.de/systar>`_ for ageing research,
the `SFB 1074 <http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/einrichtungen/sfb-1074.html>`_ for leukemia research,
or the `CAM-PaC project <http://www.cam-pac.eu/>`_ for the research of pancreatic cancer.
