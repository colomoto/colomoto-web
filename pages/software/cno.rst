CellNOpt is an open-source software used for creating logic-based models of signal transduction networks and training then with data.
While the core of CellNOpt consists of a set of R packages, it can be used through a Python wrapper, as well as a Cytoscape plug-in (CytoCopteR)
which provides support for the SBML qual format and a bridge for further analysis by other cytoscape plugins.
