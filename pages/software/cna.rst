CellNetAnalyzer (CNA) is a package for MATLAB and provides a comprehensive and user-friendly environment
for structural and functional analysis of biochemical networks.
CNA facilitates the analysis of metabolic (stoichiometric) as well as signaling and regulatory networks
solely on their network topology, i.e. independent of kinetic mechanisms and parameters.
CNA provides a powerful collection of tools and algorithms for structural network analysis
which can be started in a menu-controlled manner within interactive network maps.
Recently, API functionalities have been added to enable interested users to call algorithms
of CNA from external programs. Applications of CNA can be found in systems biology,
biotechnology, metabolic engineering, pharmacology, microbiology, chemical engineering.
