EpiLog is a tool which makes use of LogicalModel to implement a cellular automata, defining a convenient framework for the qualitative modelling of epithelium pattern formation.

EpiLog is implemented in Java and uses the MDDlib and LogicalModel tools at its core for the manipulation of Binary Decision Diagrams and multi-valued logical models, respectively.
