summary: Asynchronous updating policy
---

Only one node is updated at each time point, i.e. a separate transition is possible for each component.
Here, many alternative paths in the STG can exist. The asynchronous updating policy, considering many concurrent successor states for the
exploration of the STG, may become untractable for the analysis of large models, while the synchronous alternative may prove too simplistic.
