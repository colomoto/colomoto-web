summary: Sequential updating policy
---

The sequential updating policy can be seen as a special case of asynchronous updating.
Here, an ordering of the nodes is determined, and a sequence of successor states can be constructed by applying the regulatory functions in this order.
Like in the synchronous case, there is only a single successor state at each step.
The chosen order of the components can dramatically change the resulting STG.
