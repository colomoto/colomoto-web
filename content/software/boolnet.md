BoolNet is an R package for the construction
and analysis of synchronous, asynchronous, probabilistic and temporal Boolean networks.
It supports the simulation of such models, including the calculation and visualization of
state transition graphs, basins of attractions and attractors.
Networks can be reverse-engineered from measurements and imported from or exported to SBML qual.
The package also provides methods for the robustness assessment of models and their comparison
to randomly generated models.
